Hey there. This is my first blog post since I migrated from my `Wordpress` blog. I was a huge fan of Wordpress since the first time I came to knew about her in my 9th or 10th standard. I think it's now the right time to move on to Jekyll.  Jekyll is super fast as it don't have any database associated with it. Since there is no need of a database I can now migrate the blog from `Openshift` to `Github pages`.
