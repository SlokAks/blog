##The fundamentals

###Data Structures and Algorithms

A great programmer or developer should be strong in Data Structures and Algorithms. Once you are comfortable with your favorite language of choice (I would recommend C++) start spending time on basic Data structures and Algorithms.

* The most recommended book for studying Data structures and Algorithms is Introduction to Algorithms popularly known as CLRS.

* I would also recommend you the Design and Analysis of Algorithms on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) by Stanford University.

Here is a piece of advice I got from my super senior (Divanshu Garg, SE at Google Australia) when I was in first year. 

> Like I used to do a lot of SPOJ in the first year, and kept on reading Cormen. Honestly, back then, I usually couldn't understand everything because the book is advanced but I used to learn something every time I read it. If u cant understand a simple algo, read it over the INTERNET to understand more. then practice some related questions on SPOJ.

###Practicing Programming

It is very important to write the code when you learn a new algorithm or data structure. One way of accomplishing this is via online judges. If you love solving puzzles you would love it. Here are my favorite online judges for beginners.

* [USACO Training Gateway](http://train.usaco.org/usacogate)
* [SPOJ](http://spoj.com/)
* [LightOJ](http://lightoj.com/)
* [Codechef](http://codechef.com/)
* [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com)

Among this the USACO training gateway contains both Tutorials and Problems organized in a systematic way. This site would help you to learn the basic fundamentals quickly if you don't have much experience with algorithms. 

LightOJ contains problems organized category wise and is a good resource for preparing for ACM ICPC. 


##Becoming a hacker

###Move to Linux

Just move to Linux. Linux would be hard for a few days but you would soon find it awesome. The shell (command line in linux) is so powerful that you can accomplish almost anything with it. You can automate the system completely once you are familiar with the shell. Moreover you can tweak the OS into whatever appearance you like. All most all the web servers in Internet are powered by Linux servers. Even Microsoft use a custom tweaked version of Linux for Azure. 

You can still keep Windows as the Gaming environment of Linux sucks. I recommend you to dual boot Linux with Windows. I have attached a link which worked for my while I was dual booting Ubuntu with Windows8

Here are my favorite Linux Distros in decreasing order. 

* [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) - A Beautiful Linux OS built on top of Ubuntu. Perfect for beginners.
* [Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com/) - The most popular Linux Distro in the World
* [Mint](linuxmint.com/) - Built over Ubuntu and looks similar like Windows. 

###Read Hacker News
 Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity. Almost everyone in the Tech industry reads Hacker news. If you make something cool you should post it in Hacker News. Who knows what happens after that?

###Put all the code on Github
Whatever code you write make sure that you put it on Github the same day. There are many reasons behind this practise.
* You keep on writing the code each and every day to keep your streak

* You get an awesome Github profile
* You become an open source contributor automatically.
* Bonus - You get more followers on Github

###Do Side Projects

Every CS undergrad knows programming. To stand outside of the crowd you should work on side projects. As told by Sam Altman

> The best companies start out with ideas that don’t sound very good.  They start out as projects, and in fact sometimes they sound so inconsequential the founders wouldn't let themselves work on them if they had to defend them as a company.  Google and Yahoo started as grad students’ projects.  Facebook was a project Zuckerberg built while he was a sophomore in college.  Twitter was a side project that started with a single engineer inside a company doing something totally different.  Airbnb was a side project to make some money to afford rent.  They all became companies later.
