## Hey, how are you doing today!!

Hi, I'm Vishnu Ks and this is the source code for my website and blog, http://vishnuks.com. Feel free to browse the source, fork at will, and ask me questions. Sharing is caring!

## How it's built

All my posts are written in Markdown. The blog is powered by Jekyll, a static site generator that takes Markdown blog posts and converts them into HTML files. The benefit of this approach are many:

    The blog can be served with almost any web server, since the output of Jekyll is just flat HTML files.
    The whole blog can easily be version controlled.
    The blog requires less maintainance (goodbye out-of-date Wordpress installations!)

I host the actual site on Github pages(as it is evident from the repo name) since I don't want to startup a server just for hosting some static pages. The theme is built on top of [Dasper](https://github.com/ozgrozer/dasper). 

That's pretty much it.
